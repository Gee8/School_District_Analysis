# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
Using students_complete.csv and schools_complete.csv, we were able to draw an analysis on each schools student performance on reading and math scores. The information collected allowed us to see the percentage of students who passed reading, math and both. We were also able to see how students performed based on the funding each school alloted per student. Before we performed the analysis, prefixes and suffixes such as Dr. we're removed from the students names. The analysis was done on the entire data set, but due to a suspicion of cheating among 9th grade students at Thomas High School, these grades we're removed and the analysis was repeated. The original analysis containing all students is located in the Module Code section and the analysis without the 9th grade Thomas High School students is located in the Challenge Code section.

## Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.

- How is the district summary affected?
  - The following images depict the `district_summary_df` for the original and modified codes, respectfully.
